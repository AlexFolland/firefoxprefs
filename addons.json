This extension just makes it faster to get at.\n\nFor those asking for the old multi-function button back: Make sure you set this button so it does not show the drop down (the default setting, so change it back if you modified it). Then install Close Tab History Button and put it next this one. That is the closest I can get you to the old behavior for now.

This extension can change this behavior and select another tab according to the preference instead.\n\nThe options are:\n\n    Last accessed tab\n    Parent tab (Firefox 57 or later)\n    First/Left/Right/Last tab\n    First/Left/Right/Last unread tab\n    First/Left/Right/Last sibling/child/unread-child tab (Firefox 57 or later)\n\n\nAfter installing you can configure this extension by clicking Preferences/Options of it in the Add-ons Manager. The buttons represent the order of preference: e.g. if \"left tab\" is at the top and \"last accessed tab\" is the second, after closing the current tab it will try to select the left tab, and then the last accessed tab (if there is no tab on the left). Click the up and down icons to modify the order.","weeklyDownloads":143,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"jingyu9575","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/jingyu9575/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/193/193244.png?modified=1512034096","width":699,"height":525,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/193/193244.png?modified=1512034096","thumbnailWidth":200,"thumbnailHeight":150,"caption":"The extension preference page (2.0)"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/187/187067.png?modified=1512034092","width":700,"height":449,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187067.png?modified=1512034092","thumbnailWidth":200,"thumbnailHeight":128,"caption":"The extension preference page (1.1)"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.5526,"reviewCount":31,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/select-after-closing-current/reviews/","updateDate":1512032409000},{"id":"{8c565c3a-8e30-4710-b4d3-30a84b38259c}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/static/img/addon-icons/default-32.png","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/static/img/addon-icons/default-64.png"},"name":"YouTube Spacebar Pause","version":"1.0","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":null,"description":"Pauses YouTube Videos with Spacebar, Focussed or not.\nIf you want to scroll comments via Spacebar, simply click on a comment and start scrolling.Pressing space button doesn't stop video when the focus is on like or subscribe button.","fullDescription":null,"weeklyDownloads":14,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"3DIndian","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/3DIndian/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.4286,"reviewCount":6,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-spacebar-pause/reviews/","updateDate":1495969614000}],"compatOverrides":[]}

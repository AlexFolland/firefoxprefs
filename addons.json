It applies to the current web site only, it is not a global power button.\n\n***\n\nFlexible, it's more than an \"ad blocker\": it can also read and create filters from hosts files.\n\nOut of the box, these lists of filters are loaded and enforced:\n\n- EasyList\n- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list\n- EasyPrivacy\n- Malware domains\n\nMore lists are available for you to select if you wish:\n\n- Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List\n- Dan Pollock’s hosts file\n- hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers\n- MVPS HOSTS\n- Spam404\n- And many others\n\nOf course, the more filters enabled, the higher the memory footprint. Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\n\nAlso, be aware that

You can block sites within fixed time periods (e.g., between 9am and 5pm), after a time limit (e.g., allow up to 10 minutes in every hour), or with a combination of time periods and time limit (e.g., allow up to 10 minutes in every hour between 9am and 5pm).\n\nAdditional features:\n\n    Lockdown: Block sites immediately for a specified duration.\n    Access control: Set a password or random access code for the options page, to slow you down in moments of weakness!\n    Delaying: Set a countdown to delay access to sites instead of completely blocking them.\n    Wildcards: Block a range of sites (e.g., *.somesite.com).\n    Exceptions: Whitelist sites you don't want to be blocked (e.g., +allowedsite.com).\n\n\nVersion history: https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/version-history/\n\nUsage examples: https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/examples/\n\nPermissions explained: https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/faq/permissions/\n\nFrequently asked questions: https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/faq/\n\nCommunity support: https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/leechblock/","weeklyDownloads":1595,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"James Anderson","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/98949/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/194/194737.png?modified=1543520944","width":640,"height":400,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/194/194737.png?modified=1543520944","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Blocking Page"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/194/194738.png?modified=1543520945","width":640,"height":400,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/194/194738.png?modified=1543520945","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Delaying Page"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/194/194739.png?modified=1543520946","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/194/194739.png?modified=1543520946","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Options Page"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/194/194740.png?modified=1543520946","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/194/194740.png?modified=1543520946","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Options Page"}],"contributionURL":"https://www.paypal.me/JamesNAnderson?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.7755,"reviewCount":304,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock-ng/reviews/","updateDate":1562338516000},{"id":"{531906d3-e22f-4a6c-a102-8057b88a1a63}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/985/985621-32.png?modified=76aa1d23","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/985/985621-64.png?modified=76aa1d23","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/985/985621-128.png?modified=76aa1d23"},"name":"SingleFile | Save a page as a single HTML file","version":"1.14.4","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3472528/singlefile_save_a_page_as_a_single_html_file-1.14.4-an+fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile","supportURL":"https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile/issues","description":"Save a complete page (with stylesheets, images, etc.) as a single HTML file","fullDescription":"SingleFile is an add-on for Firefox Desktop and Mobile that helps you to save a complete page (with CSS, images, fonts, frames, etc.) as a single HTML file.\n\nGetting started\n\n    Wait until the page is fully loaded.\n    Click on the SingleFile button in the extension toolbar to process and save the page.\n    You can click again on the button to cancel the action when processing a page.\n\nDemo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdV8DBW5b0g\n\n\nAdditional notes\n\n    Open the context menu by right-clicking the SingleFile button in the extension toolbar or on the webpage.

The saved page is a highly accurate representation of the original page.\n\nSave Page WE is implemented using the new WebExtensions API and is available for both Firefox and Chrome with identical functions and user interfaces.\n\nOPTIONS PAGE\n\nThe Save Page WE Options page can be accessed as follows:\n\n• Firefox - On the menu bar select Tools > Add-ons (or press Ctrl+Shift+A), select the Extensions tab, and then click on the Options button.\n\n• Chrome - Right-click on the toolbar button, and then select Options.\n\nTOOLBAR BUTTON\n\nAfter installation of Save Page WE, there will be a new blue 'floppy-disk' button on the main toolbar.\n\nTo save a web page as an HTML file, just click on the Save Page WE toolbar button.\n\nThere is an option to set the button action as:\n\n• Save Basic Items\n• Save Standard Items\n• Save Custom Items\n\nThere is an option to prompt the user to enter comments when saving the file.\n\nThere is are options to specify the format of the saved file name. See the 'Saved File Name' section below.\n\nIn order to be prompted for the save location, the Firefox 'Downloads' option must be set to 'Always ask you where to save files'.\n\nBy default the saved HTML file will have a '.html' extension.\n\nCONTEXT MENU & BUTTON MENU\n\nTo save a web page as an HTML file, or to perform operations on a previously saved page, right-click on the page contents to open the context menu, select the 'Save Page WE' sub-menu, and then select one of the menu items:\n\n• Save Basic Items\n• Save Standard Items\n• Save Custom Items\n• View Saved Page Info\n• Remove Page Loader\n• Extract Image/Audio/Video\n\nAlternatively, right-click on the Save Page WE toolbar button to open the button menu, and then select one of the menu items.\n\nThere is an option to show/hide the Save Page WE submenu item on the context menu.\n\nNote, the 'Extract Image/Audio/Video' menu item is always shown on the context menu when viewing saved pages.\n\nKEYBOARD SHORTCUTS\n\nTo save a web page as an HTML file, press Alt+A. This shortcut can be reconfigured in the Shortcuts tab of the Save Page WE Options page.\n\nSAVED FILE NAME\n\nThere is an option to specify the format of the saved file name.\n\nThis format is used when saving the complete page and when extracting a resource (Image/Audio/Video).\n\nThe saved file name may contain the following predefined fields:\n\n• %TITLE% - (saving a page) the document title or if this is empty the same as %FILE%\n• %TITLE% - (extracting a resource) the same as %FILE%\n• %DATE(x)% - the current date in YYYYxMMxDD format, where 'x' is any character or can be omitted.\n• %TIME(x)% - the current time in HHxMMxSS format, where 'x' is any character or can be omitted.\n• %HOST% - the host name in the page or resource URL\n• %PATH% - the path in the page or resource URL without the final file extension\n• %FILE% - the file in the last segment of the path without the final file extension\n\nThere are options to replace spaces in the saved file name with a user-defined character and to set the maximum length of the saved file name.\n\nSAVED ITEMS\n\nSave Basic Items - saves these items:\n\n• HTML elements\n• HTML image files (currently displayed)\n• CSS style sheets\n• CSS image files (currently displayed)\n• CSS font files (used by this browser)\n\nSave Standard Items - saves the Basic Items and these items:\n\n• HTML image files (all)\n• HTML audio & video files\n• HTML object & embed files\n• CSS font files (woff for any browser)\n\nSave Custom Items - saves the Basic Items and the items selected from this list:\n\n• HTML image files (all)\n• HTML audio & video files\n• HTML object & embed files\n• CSS image files (all)\n• CSS font files (woff for any browser)\n• CSS font files (all)\n• Scripts (in same-origin frames)\n\nNote, scripts in cross-origin frames are never saved.\n\nThere is an option to retain cross-origin frames when saving the page. Note, cross-origin iframes often contain adverts or visitor comments.\n\nThere is an option to merge duplicate CSS images (to reduce the saved file size).\n\nThere is an option to include an information bar at the top of the saved page.\n\nThere is an option to include metrics and resource summary in the saved file.\n\nThere is an option to set the maximum depth of saved nested frames/iframes.\n\nThere is an option to purge elements that have been hidden by the page itself, or by page editors (e.g Print Edit WE), or by content blockers (e.g. uBlock Origin).\n\nCONFIGURING FIREFOX\n\nGo to Firefox Main Menu > Tools > Options > General.\n\nIn the Applications section, set the action for the 'Firefox HTML Document' content type:\n\n• Always ask - the 'What should Firefox do with this file?' dialog box will be shown.\n• Use Firefox - the saved file will be opened in Firefox.\n• Save File - the action depends on the settings in the Downloads section.\n\nIn the Downloads section, set the 'Save files to' folder location, and enable or disable the 'Always ask you where to save files' option.\n\nLOADING RESOURCES\n\nThere is an option to set the maximum size allowed for large or repeatedly referenced resources.\n\nThere is an option to set the maximum time allowed for loading individual resources.\n\nThere is an option to force lazy loading of images before saving the page.\n\nThere is an option to allow loading of passive mixed content (image,audio,video).\n\nThere is an option to send a referer header when requesting a resource. The options are: do not send a refer header, send a referer header with origin only, or send a referer header with origin and path (origin only in private browsing).\n\nUNSAVED RESOURCES\n\nThere is an option to show a warning if any resources cannot be saved.\n\nThere is an option to show a list of all resources that cannot be saved.\n\nThere is an option to remove URLs of unsaved resources, which avoids unsaved resources being loaded from the internet when the saved page is opened.\n\nSAVED FILE FORMAT\n\nThe HTML elements (as currently displayed) and all of the referenced resources are saved in a single file (.html).\n\nExternal CSS style sheets are converted to internal CSS style sheets. Frame contents and external scripts are stored as UTF-8 data URIs in the 'src' attribute. Iframe contents are stored as UTF-8 text in the 'srcdoc' attribute.\n\nAll binary resources (images, fonts, audios, videos, etc) are stored as Base64 data URIs. CSS images referenced multiple times within a frame will only be stored once in that frame. CSS fonts and HTML images/audios/videos will be stored once for each reference.\n\nNote that not all cross-origin frames can be saved.

Your geographic location is obtained through various means (eg. using wifi data) and is often highly accurate, which can be a violation of your privacy.\n\nThis extension allows you to enjoy the useful applications of geolocation while protecting your privacy. It does so by reporting a fake location to websites, obtained by adding a certain amount of \"noise\" to the real location. The noise is randomly selected in a way that ensures that the real location cannot be inferred with high accuracy.\n\nThree configurable privacy levels are provided. The higher the privacy level the greater the amount of noise, which gives better privacy at the expense of a less accurate fake location. This can be configured per-website for flexibility: a more accurate location can be provided for driving directions than for a weather forecast. There's also an option to use a fixed location, instead of adding noise to the real one. This offers the best privacy (no dependence on the real location at all), at the cost of very low accuracy.\n\nNote: your location can be also detected from your IP address, but usually with poor accuracy. Location Guard protects the accurate location revealed through the javascript API.","weeklyDownloads":1123,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Kostas Chatzikokolakis","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11105256/"},"developers":[{"name":"Marco Stronati","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/10695384/"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152196.png?modified=1543520064","width":640,"height":400,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152196.png?modified=1543520064","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Location guard in use on openstreetmap.org"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152198.png?modified=1543520065","width":640,"height":400,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152198.png?modified=1543520065","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Privacy levels configuration."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152264.png?modified=1543520067","width":364,"height":525,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152264.png?modified=1543520067","thumbnailWidth":333,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Location Guard on Android."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/152/152266.png?modified=1543520068","width":367,"height":525,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/152/152266.png?modified=1543520068","thumbnailWidth":336,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Options page on Android."}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":3.9263,"reviewCount":67,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/reviews/","updateDate":1569023439000},{"id":"undo-close-tab-buttons-single@codefisher.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/630/630686-32.png?modified=1508311222","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/630/630686-64.png?modified=1508311222","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/630/630686-128.png?modified=1508311222"},"name":"Undo Close Tab Button","version":"1.7","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/746539/undo_close_tab_button-1.7-an+fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://codefisher.org/toolbar_button/","supportURL":"https://codefisher.org/forum/","description":"Reopens the last closed tab.","fullDescription":"Adds toolbar buttons for quick access to undo the closing of tabs.\n\nThe button has two modes depending on what setting is selected.

This extension just makes it faster to get at.\n\nFor those asking for the old multi-function button back: Make sure you set this button so it does not show the drop down (the default setting, so change it back if you modified it). Then install Close Tab History Button and put it next this one. That is the closest I can get you to the old behavior for now.

Firefox 65 is the current Developer Edition and will be released on 2019-01-29.\n\nUpdate: If there are problems with tab grouping extensions (e.g. Simple Tab Groups, Panorama View), see these compatibility options in v4.0.\n\nAfter closing a tab that is currently selected, Firefox usually moves the focus to the tab on the right. This extension can change this behavior and select another tab according to the preference instead.\n\nThe options are:\n\n    Last accessed tab\n    Parent tab (Firefox 57 or later)\n    First/Left/Right/Last tab\n    First/Left/Right/Last unread tab\n    First/Left/Right/Last sibling/child/unread-child tab (Firefox 57 or later)\n\n\nAfter installing you can configure this extension by clicking Preferences/Options of it in the Add-ons Manager. The buttons represent the order of preference: e.g. if \"left tab\" is at the top and \"last accessed tab\" is the second, after closing the current tab it will try to select the left tab, and then the last accessed tab (if there is no tab on the left). Click the up and down icons to modify the order.\n\n\nKnown issues\n\nIn Firefox 64 or earlier, the tab that Firefox selects by default may be selected and shown briefly.","weeklyDownloads":102,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"jingyu9575","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/6116843/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/212/212045.png?modified=1544114236","width":975,"height":864,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/212/212045.png?modified=1544114236","thumbnailWidth":542,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"The extension preference page (4.0)"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6,"reviewCount":54,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/select-after-closing-current/reviews/","updateDate":1565452511000},{"id":"jid0-cBh0nRMLV5BY1dlp33s3g7dFXLY@jetpack","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/429/429652-32.png?modified=1489756821","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/429/429652-64.png?modified=1489756821","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/429/429652-128.png?modified=1489756821"},"name":"Tags for YouTube™","version":"8.4","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/1137438/tags_for_youtubetm-8.4-fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":null,"description":"See the tags of YouTube™ videos.","fullDescription":"Years ago, YouTube™ hid video tags from view.

This website is http://adskipperodb.blogspot.com/. It is used to store all the short links users surf. In this small website loaded it will search for the short link you are on.\nIf it finds the short link you are on, it will auto redirect to the destination by itself, (some websites could give an alert to leave the site, accept it).\nIf it doesn’t have the short link you are on, it will try to wait for the counter to hit 0, and automate a click on the button. Basically auto-skip it.\nAfter the short link has been skipped AdSkip will check the actual site, and the short link skipped and send it to the blog. Actually it will send it to an email generating a small site like in the first step so it could be checked by a program to add it in the blog.\nThose functions are made like that due to lack of money to pay a host. You will be able for now on to become a patron on https://www.patreon.com/helmitdev and help me rise enough money monthly to buy a host and make this thing more profesional.\n\n-BETA: Added link transformation on sites, now AdSkip will check every link in the site and if it is a short one it will automatically change it to the destination.\n\nDisabled things in this version\n\nOptions have been disabled in this version due to some errors, anyways you still can Turn off and on AdSkip. Just options tab wont work.","weeklyDownloads":83,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Juan","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/12245147/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/182/182761.png?modified=1543520645","width":700,"height":280,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/182/182761.png?modified=1543520645","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":256}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":2.625,"reviewCount":11,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adskip/reviews/","updateDate":1480985549000},{"id":"{8c565c3a-8e30-4710-b4d3-30a84b38259c}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/static/img/addon-icons/default-32.png","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/static/img/addon-icons/default-64.png","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/static/img/addon-icons/default-128.png"},"name":"YouTube Spacebar Pause","version":"1.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/655106/youtube_spacebar_pause-1.0-an+fx-windows.xpi?src=","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":null,"description":"Pauses YouTube Videos with Spacebar, Focussed or not.\nIf you want to scroll comments via Spacebar, simply click on a comment and start scrolling.Pressing space button doesn't stop video when the focus is on like or subscribe button.","fullDescription":null,"weeklyDownloads":13,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"3DIndian","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/12135605/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":3.8,"reviewCount":8,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-spacebar-pause/reviews/","updateDate":1495969614000}],"compatOverrides":[]}
